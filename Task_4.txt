The project robotic arm fascinates me as through this project, I would get an opportunity to delve deeper into the world of humanoids and also learn the science behind their functioning. Working for the recruitment task involving this project has already introduced me to the optimised movements of joint angles so as to reach a particular target in minimum time. It has also helped me enhance my coding skills and problem solving capabilities. I believe that this project will introduce me to the various approximations that are applicable while solving real life problems using AI and robots, similar to tolerance value used in FABRIK algorithm. It is quite interesting that even robots do not need 100% accuracy to carry out real life tasks effectively. 
In a nutshell, the usage of computer programs, electronics and several applications of mechanical engineering to develop an artifical arm, capable of performing human activities like capturing a target, has sparked my interest in this project and I look forward to learning a lot from it, upon given the opportunity.
